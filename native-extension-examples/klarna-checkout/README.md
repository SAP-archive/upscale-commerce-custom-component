# Klarna Checkout: Sample Native Extension

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-open-payment-integration)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-open-payment-integration)

## What is it?
The Klarna checkout custom component is a sample of what will be possible with our brand new overhaul of the existing custom component implementation. The existing solution is only capable of injecting iframes into an Upscale PWA. The new version of custom components, which we are calling native extensions, will be capable of injecting native angular components and services directly into an application. In addition to being visible to web-crawlers, these components will be able to interact directly with the PWAâ€™s front end state and services, enabling the merchant to build essentially anything that an Upscale developer could.

To make it easier for a merchant to create a native extension, we have created a new public-facing upscale-web-storefront-sdk containing abstract classes which the component can access. The implementations of these classes exist as part of the PWA, and when the component is loaded, any references to them resolve to the implementations in the PWA. Those services interact with the PWA state, and are what enable much of the complex functionality that a merchant would want. The component can also access our caas-service-client-angular which provides services that interface directly with the back end services, for more fine-grained control.

## Setting up the Custom Component
Follow the steps below to create your own version of the klarna-checkout native component:

**1\. Download**

Download this repository as a zip file and extract it.

**2\. Configure mapping**

Navigate to native-extensions/klarna/checkout/projects/klarna-checkout/src/lib/klarna-checkout. Open the klarna-checkout.component.ts file in your desired IDE/text editor.

Take note of the following code starting on line 110:

    const klarnaConfig = configs.find((config) => {
        return config.gatewayProviderName === 'klarna-checkout';
    });

This code is checking for a payment configuration with a gatewayProviderName matching "klarna-checkout". Feel free to change this string to something else, so long as it is consistent with that of a compatible payment configuration (more on this later).

**3\. Component mapping**

Open klarna-checkout.module.ts located in the same directory.

Take note of the following code starting on line 10:

    this.registrationService.register(
        'klarna-checkout',
        KlarnaCheckoutComponent
    );

This code is mapping the KlarnaCheckoutComponent component class to the string "klarna-checkout". The registrationService is a service which is shared between the PWA and the custom component, and essentially by providing this mapping, we are telling the PWA that this component exists. Like the gatewayProviderName property above, feel free to set this string to anything you like as well.


**4\. Publish Component Library**

Open the klarna-checkout folder in terminal and execute commands to install all dependencies, build, and package the application. For the current release, neither upscale-web-storefront-sdk nor caas-service-client-angular will be available publicly. For now, they will be bundled together with the PWA app. Download a new PWA app from Workbench, and there will be a "libs" folder containing the .tgz files you'll need to install. The exact commands are as follows:

    npm install
    npm install --save-dev <path to Upscale PWA>/libs/caas-service-client-angular-<version>.tgz
    npm install --save-dev <path to Upscale PWA>/libs/upscale-web-storefront-sdk-<version>.tgz
    npm run package

Host the generated tarball (.tgz) for the component library in a public environment such as NPM, GitHub, or S3.

**5\. Create Native Extension**

Add the library as a Native Extension within the workbench, similarly to how you would a style extension.

![create native extension](../../documentation/assets/Create_Native_Extension.png)

**6\. Assign Native Extension**

In order to add the library to an app where you wish to show the klarna checkout, select the extension name in the selectize field for extensions within the app configuration.

![assign native extension](../../documentation/assets/Assign_native_extension.png)

Note: You'll need to download the app to actually see the changes.

**7\. Configure Experience**

Navigate to the experience editor for the experience associated with the app. You will need to remove the existing checkout component within the checkout template and replace it with a custom component.

In the custom component configuration, enter the extension ID and a component identifier corresponding to the mapping done in klarna-checkout.module.ts. Hit save.

![configure experience](../../documentation/assets/configure_experience.png)

**8\. Payment Configuration**

Before the component can be used, you will need to configure a gateway or payment method with a compatible klarna script and assign it to the division associated with the app.

A postman collection to quickly setup one of these should be accessible via the [SAP-samples Github](https://github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-open-payment-integration). Instructions on how to install a payment configuration using a postman collection can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-open-payment-integration/tree/main/postman/klarna/custom-checkout).

Please also be sure to fill in your config's gatewayProviderName (labelled as "Payment gateway name") as the string specified in klarna-checkout.component.ts above.

## Testing
If all the above setup is complete, please follow the steps below to test your new custom component!

**1\. Download the app from workbench**

**2\. Extract the contents of the zip**

**3\. Install dependencies:**

Access the project root in terminal and run "npm install"

**4\. Add the library module to your application:**

Open the file src/app/core/extension.module.ts in your ide/text editor

Add the following to the first list of imports:

    import { UpscaleExtensionModule } from 'klarna-checkout';

Then add UpscaleExtensionModule to the array of native extension modules:

    // Add Native Extension Modules here
    const modules = [ UpscaleExtensionModule ];

**5\. Start app:**

Access the project root in terminal and run "npm start"

**6\. Test in browser:**

Access the application via localhost:4200, add a product to cart, and proceed to checkout. A klarna payment form should appear in the place of the regular checkout!

## How it all works
The Klarna Checkout component makes use of the aforementioned front end services made available by upscale-provided dependencies; upscale-web-storefront-sdk and caas-service-client-angular, as well as some provided by angular itself.
